## Description:
This is a React app that allows users to manage a list of students by adding them to a favorites list. The app features two main pages:

**List of Students**: A page with 10 student names and an "Add to Favorites" button. Once a student is added to the favorites, the button is disabled.

**Favorite Students:** Displays a list of favorite students with an option to remove them from the list.

## Key Features:

**Add to Favorites:** You can add a student to the favorites list with a single click, but each student can only be added once.
**Remove from Favorites:** You can remove any student from the favorites list with a dedicated remove button.
**CSS Gradient Styling:** The app uses a vibrant background with gradient colors and sleek button hover effects.
**React Router:** The app navigates between the "List of Students" and "Favorite Students" pages using react-router-dom.

## Technologies Used:

React for UI development and component-based architecture.
CSS for styling, including gradient backgrounds and hover effects.
React Router for managing navigation between pages.
